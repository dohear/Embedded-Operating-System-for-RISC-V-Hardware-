# Embedded Operating System Code

This repository contains the final embedded operating system code I developed for my Operating Systems class at Marquette University.

During the course, we encountered an "unsolvable" issue with the RISC-V framework provided by my professor after implementing memory protection (`xinu-hw7`). As a result, we had to migrate to the MIPS architecture for subsequent assignments. Due to this transition, I have included two incomplete versions of my operating system:

## RISC-V Implementation

This folder contains my work on the following components:
- Serial driver
- Context switch
- Trap handlers
- Process scheduler
- Memory protection

## MIPS Implementation

This folder includes my work on:
- File system
- Authentication layer
